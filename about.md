<p>Hi, I am <span style="color: #FE7BB0">Ritika</span>. I am a former Software Engineer with 3 years of work experience building large scale complex web applications. Currently I am pursuing a masters degree at NYU Courant in Computer Science with a course work balanced between Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing and Machine Learning. I am working as a Research Software Engineer with Prof Denis Pelli at NYU studying how to uncover early dyslexia predictors. Over the summers of 2023 I worked as a Research Engineer at Princeton University.
</p>
<p> I am looking for internship/co-op positions for my spring semester from January 2024 and full time positions from May 2024. </p>
<p>I also love building frontend applications and the UI and making things pretty and pink <i class='fas fa-star' id="star"></i>. In case you haven't noticed, I love cats too <i class="fab fa-github-square" id="paw"></i></p>
